% In Prolog, constants represent fixed values that cannot be changed during program execution.
% They are used to define facts, relationships, and data within a Prolog knowledge base.
% Types of Constants:
% 1. Atoms: Atoms are symbolic names that represent specific entities.
% Syntax:
% Lowercase letters: apple, john, likes.
% Enclosed in single quotes for special characters or starting with uppercase: 'New York', '123abc'.
% Special predefined constants: true, false, [] (empty list).

% Numbers:
% Numerical constants represent numeric values.
% Can be integers (5, 42) or floating-point numbers (3.14, -0.5)

% Strings:
% Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in double quotes like "John Doe"
% Represented as lists of ASCII codes or characters in some implementations.


% Variables in Prolog
% In Prolog, variables are placeholders that can match with values during the resolution process. 
% They are not like variables in imperative languages, where they represent fixed memory locations. 
% Instead, Prolog variables are logical placeholders used to express relationships and constraints.
% Syntax:
% Variable names must start with an uppercase letter or an underscore (_), e.g., X, Y, _Temp.
% Variables starting with an underscore (_) are often used as anonymous variables, meaning their value is irrelevant and not saved.
